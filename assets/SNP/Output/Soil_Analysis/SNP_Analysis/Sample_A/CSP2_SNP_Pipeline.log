-------------------------------------------------------

Reading in SNPDiffs files...Done!
	- Read in 14 SNPdiffs files
-------------------------------------------------------

	- Not performing SNP edge rescuing (any SNPs found within 150bp of a query contig edge will be purged)...
-------------------------------------------------------

Screening all queries against reference...Done!
	- Reference screening data saved to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/Reference_Screening.tsv
	- Of 14 comparisons, 14 covered at least 85.0% of the reference genome after removing poor alignments
-------------------------------------------------------

Compiling SNPs across 14 samples...
	- 220 total SNPs detected across all samples...
	- 167 unique SNPs passed QC filtering in at least one sample...
	- 1 unique SNPs were within 150bp of a reference contig end and were not considered in any query...
	- Skipping edge resucing...
	- 53 unique SNPs were purged in all queries they were found in, and were not considered in the final dataset...
	- Processed coverage information...
	- SNP coverage information: /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/Locus_Categories.tsv
	- Query coverage information: /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/Query_Coverage.tsv
-------------------------------------------------------

Processing alignment data...Done!
	- Saved alignment of 167 SNPs to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snpma.fasta
	- Saved ordered loc list to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snplist.txt
	- Preserving SNPs with at most 50.0% missing data...
	- Of 167 SNPs, 167 SNPs pass the 50.0% missing data threshold...
	- Saved preserved alignment to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snpma_preserved.fasta
	- Saved preserved ordered loc list to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snplist_preserved.txt
-------------------------------------------------------

Processing pairwise comparisons files...Done!
	- Saved raw pairwise distances to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snp_distance_pairwise.tsv
	- Saved raw pairwise matrix to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snp_distance_matrix.tsv
	- Saved preserved pairwise distances to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/SNP_Analysis/Sample_A/snp_distance_pairwise_preserved.tsv
