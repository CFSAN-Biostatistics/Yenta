-------------------------------------------------------

	- SNPDiffs file is in the forward orientation
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Reading in snpdiffs BED/SNP data...Done!
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Filtering for short overlaps and low percent identity...Done!
	- Raw reference genome coverage was 98.21% 
	- After filtering based on --min_len (500) and --min_iden (99.0), reference genome coverage was 97.55% 
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Filtering SNPs to get final SNP distances...
	- Raw SNP + indel count: 38

	- Unique SNP positions in reference genome: 32
		- Purged (Indel): 9
		- Purged (Query Edge): 1
Done!
	- 28 SNPs detected between Sample_M and Sample_A after filtering
	- Full SNP data saved to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/Test_CSP2/241024_Test_Output/Soil_Analysis/logs/SNP_Logs/Sample_M__vs__Sample_A_SNPs.tsv
