-------------------------------------------------------

	- SNPDiffs file is in the forward orientation
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Reading in snpdiffs BED/SNP data...Done!
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Filtering for short overlaps and low percent identity...Done!
	- Raw reference genome coverage was 97.58% 
	- After filtering based on --min_len (500) and --min_iden (99.0), reference genome coverage was 96.70% 
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Filtering SNPs to get final SNP distances...
	- Raw SNP + indel count: 1

	- Unique SNP positions in reference genome: 1
Done!
	- 1 SNPs detected between Week_42_Assembly and Lab_Control after filtering
	- SNP data saved to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/CSP2/Test_Output/241024_Test_Output/Contamination_Screen/logs/Screening_Logs/Week_42_Assembly__vs__Lab_Control_SNPs.tsv
