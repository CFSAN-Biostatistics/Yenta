Reference Isolate: Lab_Control
2024-10-17 10:29:43
-------------------------------------------------------

	- SNPDiffs file is in the forward orientation
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Reading in snpdiffs BED/SNP data...Done!
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Filtering for short overlaps and low percent identity...Done!
	- Raw reference genome coverage was 99.11% 
	- After filtering based on --min_len (500) and --min_iden (99.0), reference genome coverage was 98.65% 
-------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Filtering SNPs to get final SNP distances...
	- Raw SNP + indel count: 66

	- Unique SNP positions in reference genome: 66
		- Purged (Alignment Length + Identity): 12
		- Purged (Indel): 2
		- Purged (Query Edge): 1
		- Purged (Ref Edge): 1
Done!
	- 50 SNPs detected between Week_42_Reads and Lab_Control after filtering
	- SNP data saved to /flash/storage/scratch/Robert.Literman/NextFlow/CSP2/Test_Output/241024_Test_Output/Contamination_Screen/logs/Screening_Logs/Week_42_Reads__vs__Lab_Control_SNPs.tsv
